    <p>My childhood experience was a playful and joyful background not coming from the wealthiest background</p>
    <p>My memory as a child was playing alot with frinds and getting into trouble because of playing alot </p>
    <p>I was raised by 2 parents</p>
    <p>The discpline instilled by both parents really shaped my life,...even if we knew right from wrong they were not shy to remind us what was right and what was wrong</p>
